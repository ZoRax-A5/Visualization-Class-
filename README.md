**The homework of Zhejiang University Vis Summer Course(2019)**

------

## Introduction

This project is the homework of Zhejiang University Vis Summer Course. We use these datasets which contain the temporal network of contacts between students in a high school in Marseilles, France. And we try to use some methods which reduce snapshots to points to express the information about the students. 

## Algorithm implementation

First of all, We use python to write the back end of the project. We read the data line-by-line and create 2018 snapshots in total. Each snapshot contains the data about the contacts between students in an hour. The interval of each snapshot is 6 minutes. Then we generate adjacency matrix to express the frequency of the contacts by networkx and record the degree of the node of each snapshot. Then the graph is generated by using  high dimension vectors.  After that, we can use some the descending dimension algorithm, such as TSNE, PCA, to get the two-dimensional coordinate of each snapshot. The detail is in the file "后端数据处理.py"

The structure of the data is showed as follow:

```python
(```)
  vector:
  starttime:
  graph:{
  	directed: False
  	multigraph: False
  	graph: {}
  	nodes:
  	{
  		id:
  		group:
  		degree:
  	}
  	links:
  	{
  		weight:
  		source:
  		target:
  	}
  }
(```)
```
